# Introduction

This is my resume for IAM/authentication/authorization related roles. If you see this resume, I am applying specifically for such a role. If the role is different or broader, please check with me again for my interest in it.

I am a backend and frontend software engineer with 14 years of experience in general, with the past 6 years spent on solving problems related to authentication, session management, and authorization/approval related issues. My IAM related experience includes:

- Operational work of running IAM for large scale systems like the TikTok app at its peak (> 1 billion users, > 10 million DAU)
- Design and implementation of login and SSO flows
- Authorization and approval of high value transactions, sometimes in an adverserial environment (enterprise blockchain asset tokenization, public blockchain wallet authorization and approval)
- Team/Business authentication, authorization, and access for business customers that need to manage teams and 3rd-party service providers

# Tech stack familiarity

I have more breadth than depth due to my past experience as an independent contractor/consultant, and also from my work at consulting copmanies. I'm familiar with many of the popular tech ecosystems on the backend and frontend, public clouds, and with some limited knowledge of mobile development (non-GUI aspects; for the purpose of authentication flows, token management, and session management). Roughly:

- Backend web servers and API servers: JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, Python, C#, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Thrift, protobuf, Docker
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, D3
- Mobile: Limited knowledge of Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift for mobile (mostly around the authentication APIs, and around handling webviews/in-app-browsers)
- Public Clouds: AWS, GCP, Azure; Experience in private clouds
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Hyperledger Fabric, Go, CouchDB

# Work Experience

## ByteDance (2022 to present)

Software Engineer

At ByteDance, I work as a backend engineer in the Account team which handles the authentication, session management, authorization, and auth-related account data of TikTok and TikTok ecosystem apps (TikTok Shop, TikTok Ads, ...). The TikTok Account systems handle over a billion users and 10s of millions of DAU, and the TikTok ecosystem of apps spans dozens of web and mobile apps. At ByteDance, I work as an IC (individual contributor), sometimes a project lead, and also contribute and improve engineering processes, coding standards, tooling, and documentation for the team.

My IAM and authorization related work includes:

- Hardening of various SSO login flows, and standardizing them to use the OIDC flow.
- Development of enterprise/business authentication and authorization features, which replaced the previous practice of sharing login credentials for an account. This enabled creators/merchants/businesses/brands to authenticate and access their TikTok and TikTok Shop accounts as a team, and to grant limited access to 3rd-party service providers, or to grant temporary access to TikTok support/other staff to troubleshoot issues. Some examples of things I worked on:
  - Designed and implemented various ways to delegate access to an account (both by impersonation and by authorization)
  - Designed and implemented various ways to share accounts, where a TikTok account can be used/accessed by multiple users
  - Designed a centralized (across all TikTok ecosystem apps) authorization system for businesses/teams
- Operational work, where I handle server-reliability issues, monitor anomalous metrics (attack detection), assist with security incidents, fix security vulnerabities and weaknesses, and address user feedback that benefits from a technical fix or improvement.

## Atato (2022 to 2023)

Senior Software Architect (contract role)

Atato is a startup, where its primary product is a blockchain custodial wallet, for businesses and users to store, send, and manage high-value blockchain tokens. At Atato, I worked as an IC/lead backend engineer (job title not the same as actual work), spend half my time on architectural and high level technical design, and the other half on implementation/coding.

My IAM and authorization related work includes:

- Designed an authorization/approval/attestation flow where approvers use cryptographic signatures to indicate their approval. Implemented the backend part of this system.
- Designed a rule engine to determine whether approval is needed (and what level/kind of approval) for a token transfer, based on user and wallet risk profile, prior authorization, and value transferred.
- Supported security audits, where I created and maintained complete documentation of the authentication, authorization, key storage, and payments/token-transfer parts of the system for the purpose of audits and paper trail.

## Personal Projects (2021 to 2023)

Created various Ethereum blockchain contracts for token sales, NFTs, and stable coins.

## Aaqua (2021 to 2022)

Senior Blockchain Engineer

Aaqua is a social media startup that tried to be a Facebook without ads, and which closed down in 2022. At Aaqua, I worked as an IC blockchain and frontend engineer on the blockchain-based rewards system for social media, and also on user/community growth user-analytics for community-managers.

## IBM (2018 to 2020)

Staff Software Engineer in IBM Research team, ICBI (IBM Centre for Blockchain Innovation)

At IBM, I worked as an IC blockchain engineer, and spent 1/3 of my time as a consultant for IBM customers, and the other 2/3 as an R&D engineer for projects that involve the use of Hyperledger Fabric.

My IAM and authorization related work includes:

- Designed and implemented a framework for asset tokenization and various attestation/approval flows as the asset is verified, stored, tokenized, and traded. This framework was used for use-cases like tokenizing assets for precious metal trading on the blockchain, cross border payments proof of concept, and various other blockchain tokenization attempts.
- Implemented a proof of concept for secure and confidential document sharing (cryptographically secured) on the blockchain (blockchain used to exchange secrets, proof of creation, and as the source of identity) for electronic bill of lading (freight).

## Noggin (2017 to 2018)

Senior Software Engineer

Noggin is a centralised consumer data for marketing platform startup, which stopped operations in 2018. At Noggin, I worked as a software engineer that covered all technical roles (it was a small team). My primary focus was on developing a geo-local data visualization platform for consumer data from mobile apps, to present insights into geo-local consumer movement and attention to corporate marketing departments.

## Self Employed (2013 to 2016)

Software Engineer (contract roles)

I worked independently as a software engineer taking up multiple short-term contract roles. My work generally involved automation of various manual office processes and workflows and upgrading PC based legacy apps to internal web-based apps, ... . I also designed and implemented a factory/production-plant machine sensors live analytics view.

## Ufinity (2010 to 2012)

Software Engineer

Ufinity is a consulting firm that (at that time) works with the Singapore government, Singapore government linked companies, and other large Singapore-based businesses. At Ufinity, I worked a software engineer on various web apps for MOE (Ministry of Education, Singapore), and equity and derivative systems for SGX (Singapore Exchange).
